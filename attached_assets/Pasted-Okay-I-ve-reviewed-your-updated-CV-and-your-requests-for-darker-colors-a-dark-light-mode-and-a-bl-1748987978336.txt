Okay, I've reviewed your updated CV and your requests for darker colors, a dark/light mode, and a blog page.

Based on this, I'll provide a comprehensively updated and detailed prompt for creating your portfolio website. This new prompt will incorporate the information from your latest CV, specify color palettes for both light and dark modes, detail the structure for a new blog page, and maintain the focus on a modern, visually appealing, and animated design.

Here is the updated detailed prompt:

Prompt for Portfolio Website Creation (V2 - Dark/Light Mode & Blog):

Objective: Create a professional, visually engaging, and modern multi-page portfolio website for Animesh Bhattacharjee, a Computer Science student with a strong passion for AI, machine learning, and full-stack development. The website must effectively showcase his skills, updated experience, projects (including the new "Secure Blog Vault"), and provide clear contact options. It should feature a user-toggleable dark and light mode and include a new blog section.

Target Audience: Potential employers, collaborators, academic connections, and readers of his technical blog.

Overall Tone & Style:

Professional & Sophisticated: The design should be clean, polished, and reflect deep expertise in computer science, especially in AI/ML and secure development.
Modern & Tech-Forward: Utilize contemporary design trends, smooth animations (theme-aware), and high-quality visuals.
User-Centric: Intuitive navigation, clear information hierarchy, and excellent readability in both light and dark modes.
Color Palettes & Themeing:

General Principle: The website should default to one mode (e.g., light or system preference) and offer a clear, easily accessible toggle for switching between light and dark modes. Colors should be chosen for excellent contrast and readability in both themes.

Light Mode:

Background: Very Light Gray (e.g., Tailwind bg-slate-100 or bg-gray-100).
Card/Surface Background: White (e.g., bg-white).
Primary Text: Dark Slate/Gray (e.g., text-slate-700 or text-gray-700).
Headings/Emphasis Text: A slightly darker Slate/Gray (e.g., text-slate-800 or text-gray-900).
Primary Accent (for CTAs, links, key highlights): A strong, professional Blue (e.g., bg-blue-600, text-blue-600).
Secondary Accent (for secondary CTAs, decorative elements, some icons): A vibrant Teal (e.g., bg-teal-500, text-teal-500) OR a warm Amber (e.g., bg-amber-500, text-amber-500). Animesh to choose preferred secondary accent, or use them contextually.
Dark Mode:

Background: Very Dark Blue/Gray (e.g., bg-slate-900 or bg-gray-900).
Card/Surface Background: Dark Gray/Slightly Lighter than BG (e.g., bg-slate-800 or bg-gray-800).
Primary Text: Light Gray/Off-White (e.g., text-slate-300 or text-gray-300).
Headings/Emphasis Text: A brighter Off-White (e.g., text-slate-100 or text-gray-100).
Primary Accent: A slightly brighter/more vivid Blue (to stand out on dark) (e.g., bg-blue-500, text-blue-400).
Secondary Accent: A brighter Teal (e.g., bg-teal-400, text-teal-300) OR a lighter Amber (e.g., bg-amber-400, text-amber-300).
Typography:

Headings: A modern, clean sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Montserrat, Lato, Open Sans).
Body Text: A highly readable sans-serif font, complementary to the heading font (e.g., Inter, Open Sans, Roboto).
Code Snippets (for Blog): A clear monospaced font (e.g., Fira Code, Source Code Pro).
Consistency: Maintain consistent font usage and hierarchy across both themes.

For the blog, ensure proper meta tags for each post.
Accessibility (A11y):

Ensure sufficient color contrast in both modes.
